# Prompting Guidelines for Effective Communication

- **Be Specific and Clear**: Use precise language to describe what you want. If you're looking for code changes, specify the functionality or bug you're addressing. For example, instead of saying "fix my code," say "modify the login function in `auth.js` to handle incorrect password errors by displaying a user-friendly message."

- **Provide Context**: Give a brief background if the task is part of a larger project or has specific constraints. For instance, mention if the code must adhere to a particular framework or style guide.

- **Break Down Complex Tasks**: If your request involves multiple steps, list them out. This helps tackle each part systematically. For example:
  1. Add a new endpoint in `api.py` for user registration.
  2. Update the database schema in `schema.sql` to include a new table for user preferences.
  3. Write a test case in `test_api.py` to verify the endpoint.

- **Use Examples**: If you have a particular output or style in mind, provide an example. This could be a snippet of code or a description of the desired result.

- **Mention Files or Directories**: If your request relates to specific files or directories, name them explicitly. This helps target searches or edits accurately.

- **State Your Goal**: Let me know the end goal of your request. Understanding whether you're optimizing for performance, readability, or a specific feature helps tailor responses.

- **Ask for Explanation if Needed**: If you want to understand the reasoning or the code provided, just ask. I'm happy to explain the thought process.
